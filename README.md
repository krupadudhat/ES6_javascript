# ES6 JavaScript Concepts Overview 
This repository contains examples and explanations of key ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) concepts in JavaScript. The goal is to provide a comprehensive guide for developers looking to understand and implement the latest features introduced in ES6.

# Key Features
Arrow Functions: Simplified function syntax for cleaner and more concise code.
Classes: Introduction to class syntax for object-oriented programming.
Template Literals: Enhanced string interpolation and multi-line strings.
Destructuring: Extracting values from arrays and objects into distinct variables.
Modules: Modular code structure with import and export statements.
Promises: Improved asynchronous programming with promises.
Let and Const: Block-scoped variable declarations.
Default Parameters: Setting default values for function parameters.
Rest and Spread Operators: Handling function arguments and array manipulations.
Enhanced Object Literals: Shorthand property names and method definitions.
Iterators and Generators: Custom iteration and generator functions.
Symbols: Unique and immutable data types for object properties.
Technologies Used
JavaScript (ES6): The primary language used for implementing the examples.
